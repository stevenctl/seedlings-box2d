# Seedlings

Seedlings is a game I (Steven Landow), and Trent Brew created this fall. We want to release the game on Android, Steam, and possibly iOS. 25% of any sales or ad revenue would go to the World Wildlife Foundation. We hope to start the Kickstarter in April of 2016 and feel hope to release in July of the same year. I hope you enjoy our what we have so far, and stay tuned for updates!

We haven'thad much time to work on it yet, but with our high-school sports ending we should have a bit more time to make this thing awesome!

# Story Mode 
The story will tell the tale of the Seedlings, natural beings who live everywhere in nature; forests, caves, volcanoes, tundras, etc. 
An evil corporation made headed by a selfish CEO who controls his Robot minions wants to tear down their home to make way for more department stores, resorts, and other frivolous things.
The gentle Seedlings will have to team up to save their home!

I have included a Demo Mode along side the main game.

Some of the art and music is _NOT_ ours! We don't want to steal it, either. We are in the process of tracking down the source of this material and either removing it from the game or buying a licence to use it and crediting you.
